                    Immigration rules, visa requirements, customs regulations and safety guidelines can change at any time without
                    notice. Before you travel, you should always confirm details directly with official sources such as Mongolian

                    What You Need to Know Before Travelling to Mongolia:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To enter Mongolia, your passport should be valid for at least six months beyond the date you arrive and
                    should contain at least two blank pages for entry and exit stamps. Some nationalities may enter Mongolia
                    without a visa for short tourism or business stays, while others must obtain a visa in advance. If you plan
                    to stay longer than thirty days, you must register with the Immigration Agency of Mongolia within forty-eight
                    hours of your arrival. Failing to register can lead to fines or problems when leaving the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mongolia has a harsh continental climate and very large open spaces. Summers are generally warm and short,
                    while winters are extremely cold with temperatures that can fall far below zero. The most popular time to
                    visit is from late spring to early autumn, when conditions are milder and many rural routes are accessible.
                    Weather can still change quickly, especially in the countryside, so it is important to pack layers, waterproof
                    clothing and sturdy footwear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Medical facilities in Ulaanbaatar are better than in the rest of the country, but services outside the capital
                    may be limited. Travellers are strongly encouraged to have comprehensive travel insurance that includes
                    medical treatment and emergency evacuation. You should speak with a healthcare professional before travelling
                    to check which vaccinations or medications are recommended for your trip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The local currency is the Mongolian Tugrik (MNT). Credit and debit cards are increasingly accepted in
                    Ulaanbaatar, but cash is still important for smaller businesses and for any travel outside major towns.
                    Currency should be exchanged only at banks and official exchange points. ATMs are common in the capital but
                    cannot be relied on in remote areas, so it is wise to plan ahead and carry enough cash for rural journeys.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mongolian culture places a high value on hospitality and respect. When visiting families, gers or religious
                    sites, it is polite to follow local customs. Simple gestures such as accepting items with both hands, moving
                    around the inside of a ger in a clockwise direction and avoiding stepping on thresholds are appreciated.
                    At monasteries and temples, visitors should dress modestly and ask for permission before photographing monks,
                    ceremonies or religious objects.

                    Visa Process and Who to Contact:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Visa rules for Mongolia depend on your nationality, your reason for visiting and the length of your stay.
                    Some visitors can enter Mongolia visa-free for short tourist or business stays, while others must obtain a
                    visa before arrival. For longer stays or for purposes such as work, study or extended travel, an appropriate
                    visa is always required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, visa applications require a completed application form, a valid passport, passport photographs
                    and payment of the relevant fee. Some travellers may also be able to apply for an electronic visa through
                    Mongolia's official online system. Because the rules and eligible nationalities can change, it is important to
                    check the latest information directly with Mongolian authorities before applying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the most accurate and up-to-date visa information, travellers should contact the official Mongolian 
                    authorities. Visa rules and eligibility vary depending on nationality, and requirements may change without notice. 
                    The <span style="font-weight: 650;">Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mongolia</span> 
                    (<a href="https://www.gov.mn/en/organization/mfa">https://www.gov.mn/en/organization/mfa</a>) and the 
                    <span style="font-weight: 650;">Immigration Agency of Mongolia</span> (<a href="https://immigration.gov.mn/">
                    https://immigration.gov.mn/</a>) provide current guidance on visa types, extensions, and entry rules. Travellers 
                    may also apply through Mongolia's official <span style="font-weight: 650;">eVisa portal</span> at 
                    <a href="https://evisa.mn/">https://evisa.mn/</a> or contact their nearest <span style="font-weight: 650;">Mongolian

                <p>
                    If you remain in Mongolia for more than thirty days, you must register with the Immigration Agency of
                    Mongolia within forty-eight hours of arriving. This requirement applies even if you entered the country
                    without needing a visa. <span style="font-weight: 650;">Registration is usually done in person in Ulaanbaatar</span>. Overstaying your permitted
                    period of stay or failing to register when required can result in fines and delays when you leave the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the most accurate and up-to-date information on visas and entry requirements, travellers should contact
                    the nearest Mongolian embassy or consulate. These offices can provide details on visa types, supporting
                    documents, current fees and processing times. Once in Mongolia, questions about registration, extensions or
                    changes to your immigration status should be directed to the Immigration Agency of Mongolia.

                <h2 class="titles">
                    Imports and Exports Allowed To and From Mongolia:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When entering Mongolia, travellers must follow Mongolian customs regulations. Certain items are strictly
                    prohibited, including illegal drugs and narcotics, dangerous substances, unlicensed firearms, explosives,
                    ammunition, pornographic materials and items that threaten public safety or national security. Endangered
                    wildlife, products made from protected species and some biological materials may not be brought into or taken
                    out of the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal quantities of prescription medicine are normally allowed, but medication must be for your own use and
                    should ideally be carried in original packaging together with any relevant prescriptions. Larger quantities of
                    medicine, professional medical equipment and certain technical devices may need additional documentation or
                    prior approval from Mongolian authorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Travellers can carry foreign currency into Mongolia. However, amounts above a certain level, typically
                    equivalent to several thousand US dollars, must be declared on arrival using a customs declaration form.
                    Travellers are not normally allowed to import or export Mongolian Tugrik. You should keep your customs
                    declaration until you leave the country, as officials may ask to see it when you depart if you are carrying
                    large amounts of currency or expensive items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goods brought into Mongolia for personal use, such as clothing, cameras, small electronic devices and other
                    everyday items, are generally allowed and may be brought in duty-free in reasonable quantities. There are
                    limits on duty-free tobacco, alcohol and perfume; anything above these limits may be subject to customs duty.
                    If you are carrying items such as professional filming equipment, musical instruments or tools, it is a good
                    idea to declare them on arrival so that you can take them out of the country again without difficulty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When leaving Mongolia, travellers must be careful with cultural and natural heritage items. Antiques,
                    archaeological objects, religious artefacts, old manuscripts, museum-quality pieces and other items judged to
                    have cultural or historical value cannot be exported without a special permit from the relevant Mongolian
                    authority. Similar restrictions may apply to fossils, certain minerals and some types of precious stones.
                    Without the correct paperwork, these items may be confiscated by customs officials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Travellers who have been hunting or taking part in sporting events should make sure that any weapons,
                    ammunition and related equipment were declared on entry and are documented correctly for departure. If you are
                    unsure whether an item may be imported or exported, you should ask Mongolian customs officials for guidance
